            <div class="Box">
<p class="text-center font-35">I'm Havannah Blem, a 22-year-old designer born and raised in South Africa. I grew up surrounded by art and creativity, with both my grandparents being artists and founders of an art school that's still running after 55 years. My mother also studied art in university, and many of my cousins are artists, ranging from potters and sculptors to traditional painters. I've always had a passion for art, and my journey began with photography in high school, where I excelled and developed a deep love for ceramics as a form of escape from the hustle and bustle of life.</p>
<p class="text-center font-35"> While I haven't been able to fully explore my love for pottery due to time and financial constraints, I've found a new appreciation for design and animation. As I complete my degree in design, I've come to appreciate the effort and creativity that goes into every aspect of design, from fonts and web pages to animations on TV.</p>
<p class="text-center font-35">As a creative person, I find joy in exploring different forms of art and design. While I don't have a distinct style, I draw inspiration from Japanese design and color schemes, influenced by my love for Japanese ceramics and life philosophies. It's my dream to visit Japan and experience the culture firsthand.</p>
<p class="text-center font-35">As I continue to evolve as a person and designer, I embrace the fact that my style and tastes will change over time. I find comfort in the Japanese concept of "wabi-sabi," which means finding beauty in imperfection. This philosophy resonates with me and serves as a reminder to always strive for authenticity and embrace the unique qualities that make us who we are.</p>
